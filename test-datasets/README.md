## Test datasets

In this folder, test datasets can be found and a working example will be given.

The folder comprises of two datasets; one with earthquakes from the years 1950 to 2000, and another dataset with earthquakes from the year 2000 up until 2021.
The dataset is obtained and configured from the Significant Earthquake Database http://www.qgistutorials.com/en/
For the sake of testing with the script, the dataset has been split in two, so that two heatmaps can be created simultaneously.
